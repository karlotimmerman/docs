## Component Overview

The 3WM system is built with a modular architecture where each component has a specific responsibility.

## Core Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Gateway" icon="server">
    FastAPI-based REST API handling all client requests
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="OCR Service" icon="eye">
    Document text extraction using DocTR and TrOCR
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="AI Engine" icon="brain">
    LangGraph agents for extraction and queries
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Layer" icon="database">
    Multi-database architecture for different data types
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## API Gateway

The FastAPI gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests.

### Responsibilities
- Request routing and validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Response formatting
- Error handling

### Key Modules
```python
app/
├── api/          # API endpoints
├── core/         # Core functionality
├── middleware/   # Request middleware
└── main.py       # Application entry
```

## OCR Service

Handles document text extraction with multiple engines.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DocTR Engine">
    - Primary OCR engine
    - Optimized for printed text
    - Fast processing (2-3s per page)
    - Supports multiple languages
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="TrOCR Engine">
    - Fallback OCR engine
    - Better for handwritten text
    - Transformer-based architecture
    - Higher accuracy but slower
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## AI Engine

The AI engine uses LangGraph to orchestrate multiple specialized agents.

### Agent Types

1. **Extraction Agent**
   - Extracts structured data from text
   - Handles European formats
   - Provides confidence scores

2. **Enrichment Agent**
   - Adds vendor information
   - Links historical data
   - Detects patterns

3. **Validation Agent**
   - Verifies extracted data
   - Checks business rules
   - Flags anomalies

4. **Query Agent**
   - Handles natural language queries
   - Accesses multiple data sources
   - Maintains conversation context

## Data Layer

### PostgreSQL
- User management
- Session storage
- Document metadata
- Audit logs

### Neo4j
- Vendor relationships
- Fraud patterns
- Network analysis
- Graph algorithms

### Supabase
- Vector embeddings
- File storage
- Real-time updates
- Edge functions

### Redis
- Response caching
- Rate limiting
- Session cache
- Pub/sub messaging

## Integration Points

Each component communicates through well-defined interfaces:

```python
# Example: OCR to AI Engine
ocr_result = await ocr_service.process(document)
extraction = await ai_engine.extract(ocr_result.text)
enriched = await graph_service.enrich(extraction)
```

## Scaling Considerations

- **Stateless Design**: All components are stateless
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more instances as needed
- **Queue-Based**: Background tasks use queues
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching at multiple levels

## Next Steps

- [Security](/3wm-project/architecture/security) - Security implementation
- [API Design](/3wm-project/api-reference/overview) - API architecture
