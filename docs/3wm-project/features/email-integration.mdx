# Email Integration

3WM integrates with Microsoft Outlook to automatically process invoices received via email, eliminating manual document handling.

## Overview

<Card title="Automated Email Processing" icon="inbox">
  The system monitors designated email folders and automatically:
  
  - Detects and extracts invoice attachments
  - Processes PDFs, images, and other formats
  - Links invoices to email metadata
  - Maintains audit trail of email source
  - Handles multiple attachments per email
</Card>

## Microsoft Outlook Integration

### Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Azure App Registration">
    Register an application in Azure AD for OAuth2 authentication
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="API Permissions">
    Grant Mail.Read and Mail.ReadWrite permissions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Credentials">
    Add client ID, secret, and tenant ID to environment
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Microsoft Outlook Integration
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
OUTLOOK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/auth/callback

# Email Processing Settings
EMAIL_POLL_INTERVAL=300  # Check every 5 minutes
EMAIL_FOLDER_NAME=Invoices  # Folder to monitor
EMAIL_PROCESS_UNREAD_ONLY=true
EMAIL_MARK_AS_READ=true
EMAIL_MOVE_PROCESSED=true

## Implementation

### Email Monitor Service

```python
class OutlookMonitor:
    """Monitor Outlook inbox for new invoices"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = OutlookClient(
            client_id=OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID,
            client_secret=OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET,
            tenant_id=OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID
        )
        
    async def process_inbox(self):
        """Process unread emails with attachments"""
        
        # Get unread messages
        messages = await self.client.get_messages(
            folder=EMAIL_FOLDER_NAME,
            filter="hasAttachments eq true and isRead eq false",
            top=50
        )
        
        for message in messages:
            try:
                await self.process_message(message)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to process {message.id}: {e}")
                
    async def process_message(self, message):
        """Process single email message"""
        
        # Extract metadata
        email_data = {
            "message_id": message.id,
            "sender": message.sender,
            "subject": message.subject,
            "received": message.received_datetime,
            "body_preview": message.body_preview
        }
        
        # Process each attachment
        for attachment in message.attachments:
            if self.is_valid_invoice(attachment):
                await self.process_attachment(attachment, email_data)
        
        # Mark as processed
        await self.mark_processed(message)
```

### Attachment Processing

```python
async def process_attachment(self, attachment, email_data):
    """Process email attachment as invoice"""
    
    # Save attachment
    file_path = await self.save_attachment(attachment)
    
    # Create document record
    document = await create_document(
        filename=attachment.name,
        source="email",
        metadata={
            "email_id": email_data["message_id"],
            "sender": email_data["sender"],
            "subject": email_data["subject"],
            "received_date": email_data["received"]
        }
    )
    
    # Process through standard pipeline
    result = await process_invoice(
        file_path=file_path,
        document_id=document.id,
        metadata=email_data
    )
    
    # Send confirmation if configured
    if EMAIL_SEND_CONFIRMATIONS:
        await self.send_confirmation(email_data["sender"], result)
    
    return result
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Email Processing Metrics

```sql
-- Daily email processing stats
SELECT 
    DATE(processed_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as emails_processed,
    SUM(attachment_count) as attachments_processed,
    AVG(processing_time_seconds) as avg_processing_time,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed
FROM email_processing_log
WHERE processed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(processed_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Sender Analytics

```sql
-- Top senders by volume
SELECT 
    sender_domain,
    COUNT(*) as invoice_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_value,
    AVG(processing_confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM email_invoices
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY sender_domain
ORDER BY invoice_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
